Fynnli settled into the captain’s chair and began to survey the starscape through Cali Jo’s special telescope. As she scanned the heavens, she noticed two small, uncharted planets that seemed to be orbiting each other in a tight dance. 

“Whoa, Cali Jo, take a look at this,” Fynnli exclaimed, gesturing excitedly to the telescope. “Those planets are like nothing I’ve ever seen before!”

Cali Jo chirped in response, while Fynnli keyed in the coordinates, eager to explore their mysteries. The planets were unlike anything she had ever encountered in her space travels. One was vibrant blue, with swirling clouds and a glittering atmosphere that shimmered in the sunlight. The other was dusky red, with jagged peaks and deep valleys that plunged into the planet’s core.

Fynnli marveled at the beauty and the complexity of the two planets as she scanned them with her instruments. She knew that she had to explore these planets, even through they posed a great challenge. 

“Okay, Cali Jo, let’s do this,” Fynnli said, her voice stead as she prepared for take off. “We’ve got two uncharted planets to explore.”
